### The Dashed skin is a skin I've been working on for around a year now, It started off with the name Material++ (which you can find [here](https://github.com/Hubza/MPP-osu)), then it got renamed to Eclipsed, then a while later, got moved to the team SolarTeam. A bit later on SolarTeam was renamed to EclipsedTeam and Eclipsed (the skin) was renamed to Dashed, which brings us here after a little time. 

This skin is currently WIP (Work in Progress) but you can always try the latest stable version below!

### Tutorial for pre-releases
Firstly, go to Code, you're probably there already, then go to [releases](https://github.com/eclipsedteam/Dashed/releases). There you'll find a .osk file. Click it, and it will start downloading. Once it is done, open it. It will open osu!, but with the skin! If you want to revert/change it at any time, go to the osu! options, then go to the section Skin (paint brush icon), and there you go!
